title: The Carnival comes to Town, but the clowns have always been here
description: The Contacts Plus farm takes on homesteading in another episode, the crew all eagerly awaiting the fair at the end. Everyone brings the best of their gear, then goes fishing and shooting targets for a LOOONG time... longer for Glitch as he displays a bit of a Gambling problem, but also skill as he starts to figure out patterns. All the tickets and all the carnival fun as the clowns of the crew enjoy their time at a fun fair.
