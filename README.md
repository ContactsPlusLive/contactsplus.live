Welcome to the development repository for https://www.contactsplus.live. The website is built with Node.js, [Astro](https://astro.build), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).

The website is set up on Jenkins to auto-deploy to Cloudflare Pages when changes are made to any branch. Preview branches are set up at `https://{branch}.contactsplus-web.pages.dev`. The `main` branch is deployed at `https://www.contactsplus.live`.

All PRs are reviewed by NootSponge before merging.
